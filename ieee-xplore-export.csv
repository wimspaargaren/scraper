Recently, the adversarial example attack, in which the input data are only slightly modified, although not an issue for human interpretation, is a serious threat to a DNN as an attack as it causes the machine to misinterpret the data. The adversarial example attack has been receiving considerable attention owing to its potential threat to machine learning. It is divided into two categories: targeted adversarial example and untargeted adversarial example. The untargeted adversarial example happens when machines misclassify an object into an incorrect class. In contrast, the targeted adversarial example attack causes machines to misinterpret the image as the attacker's desired class. Thus, the latter is a more elaborate and powerful attack than the former. The existing targeted adversarial example is a single targeted attack that allows only one class to be recognized. However, in some cases, a multitargeted adversarial example can be useful for an attacker to make multiple models recognize a single original image as different classes. For example, an attacker can use a single road sign generated by a multi-targeted adversarial example scheme to make model A recognize it as a stop sign and model B recognize it as a left turn, whereas a human might recognize it as a right turn. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-targeted adversarial example that attacks multiple models within each target class with a single modified image. To produce such examples, we carried out a transformation to maximize the probability of different target classes by multiple models. We used the MNIST datasets and TensorFlow library for our experiment. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme for generating a multi-targeted adversarial example achieved a 100% attack success rate.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866197","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea Government (MSIT); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion; Korea Government (MSIT) (Security Technologies for Financial Fraud Prevention on Fintech); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8439941","Deep neural network (DNN);evasion attack;adversarial example;machine learning","Target recognition;Distortion;Machine learning;Training;Neural networks;Image recognition;Perturbation methods","image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;probability;security of data","evasion attack;deep neural network;untargeted adversarial example;targeted adversarial example attack;multitargeted adversarial example scheme;image recognition;speech recognition;pattern analysis;intrusion detection;human interpretation;machine learning;probability;tensorflow library","","6","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, adversarial examples created by adding a little noise to an original sample can lead to misclassification by a DNN. Conventional studies on adversarial examples have focused on ways of causing misclassification by a DNN by modulating the entire image. However, in some cases, a restricted adversarial example may be required in which only certain parts of the image are modified rather than the entire image and that results in misclassification by the DNN. For example, when the placement of a road sign has already been completed, an attack may be required that will change only a specific part of the sign, such as by placing a sticker on it, to cause misidentification of the entire image. As another example, an attack may be required that causes a DNN to misinterpret images according to a minimal modulation of the outside border of the image. In this paper, we propose a new restricted adversarial example that modifies only a restricted area to cause misclassification by a DNN while minimizing distortion from the original sample. It can also select the size of the restricted area. We used the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets to evaluate the performance. We measured the attack success rate and distortion of the restricted adversarial example while adjusting the size, shape, and position of the restricted area. The results show that the proposed scheme generates restricted adversarial examples with a 100% attack success rate in a restricted area of the whole image (approximately 14% for CIFAR10 and 1.07% for ImageNet) while minimizing the distortion distance.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915971","National Research Foundation of Korea; Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Security Technologies for Financial Fraud Prevention on Fintech; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710245","Deep neural network (DNN);adversarial example;machine learning;evasion attack;restricted area","Distortion;Distortion measurement;Neural networks;Shape;Training;Speech recognition;Rate distortion theory","image classification;neural nets;speech recognition","DNN;restricted adversarial example;speech recognition;deep neural networks;evasion attack;image recognition","","1","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover, we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a more optimal routing plan.

However, the inherent uncertainty in P2P loans can result in huge financial losses for P2P platforms. Therefore, accurate risk prediction is critical to the success of P2P lending platforms. Indeed, even a small improvement in credit risk prediction would be of benefit to P2P lending platforms. This paper proposes an innovative credit risk prediction framework that fuses base classifiers based on a Choquet fuzzy integral. Choquet integral fusion improves creditworthiness evaluations by synthesizing the prediction results of multiple classifiers and finding the largest consistency between outcomes among conflicting and consistent results. The proposed model was validated through experimental analysis on a real-world dataset from a well-known P2P lending marketplace. The empirical results indicate that the combination of multiple classifiers based on fuzzy Choquet integrals outperforms the best base classifiers used in credit risk prediction to date.

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for discovering investors' personalized preferences in stock markets. Our work is able to estimate investors' personalized preferences for each stock and thus helpful for realizing investment recommendation, for instance through recommending real-time news or others' opinions on stocks preferred by the target user. Compared to conventional approaches, our method effectively incorporates stock movements for estimating investors' preference. By capturing stock-movement patterns influencing users' preferences, our method can find users with a similar investment philosophy and then increase the effect of preference prediction. An experimental evaluation with two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",";","","10.1109/ICTAI.2018.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576049","Recommendation Systems, Personalization, Stock Markets, Fintech","Investment;Stock markets;Mathematical model;Filtering;Tools;Real-time systems;Predictive models","estimation theory;investment;stock markets","stock-movement aware approach;stock markets;stock-movement patterns;preference prediction;investors personalized preferences;investor preference estimation","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commercial banks' interest in innovation is determined by the threat of steadily declining business profitability and a new competitive threat to traditional sources of income from new fin-technologies. Despite the active development of crypto-innovations (algorithms, platforms, crypto-currencies), the use of blockchain by banks in the financial sector is still very modest. Like most of the participants in this market, banks only carefully test computer technologies for managing a distributed ledger, and therefore objective barriers hindering progress in this area are of actual interest to specialists and researchers. The application of any innovative technology in the banking business depends on the successful compliance of new opportunities and time-tested requirements of consumers in the financial sector. In particular for the technology of the blockchain, just has not fully resolved key-problems of standardization, boundary identification, security and cyber-security, reliability of execution transaction, scalability of projects, etc. Here considered the main barriers, from the author's viewpoint, of implementation of the blockchain in the banking business, confirmed by the authoritative materials of centers for innovative financial technology.","","","10.1109/IC-AIAI.2018.8674451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674451","bank;distributed registry;DLT;blockchain","Blockchain;Cryptocurrency;Distributed ledger;Companies","banking;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing","boundary identification;cyber-security;business profitability;commercial banks;blockchain technology;innovative financial technology;banking business;objective barriers;computer technologies;financial sector;crypto-currencies;crypto-innovations;competitive threat","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep convolutional neural network, one of the promising deep neural networks, can handle the local relationship between their nodes which can make this model powerful in the area of image and speech recognition. In this paper, we propose the deep convolutional neural network architecture that predicts whether a given customer is proper for bank telemarketing or not. The number of layers, learning rate, initial value of nodes, and other parameters that should be set to construct deep convolutional neural network are analyzed and proposed. To validate the proposed model, we use the bank marketing data of 45,211 phone calls collected during 30 months, and attain 76.70% of accuracy which outperforms other conventional classifiers.","","","10.1109/SOCPAR.2015.7492828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492828","Deep learning;Convolutional neural network;Bank telemarketing;Fintech;Big data","Neural networks;Feature extraction;Kernel;Convolution;Instruments;Correlation;Support vector machines","banking;Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);marketing;neural net architecture","bank telemarketing data;financial Big Data;machine learning classifiers;automatic feature extraction;deep neural networks;deep-convolutional neural network architecture;learning rate;node value;layer number;phone calls","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
