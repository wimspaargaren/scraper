Artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning (ML) can assist in the software specification process by providing support to system designers. This paper presents an approach based on explanation-based learning (EBL), a ML technique in which a concept is learned by building an explanation. The approach is presented in the context of the system LISE (Learning in Software Engineering). LISE converts a user requirement for a software module into an operational module definition using EBL with an incomplete theory. An example where LISE is used to build the specification of a banking system is illustrated.<>","","","10.1109/AIAWS.1991.236591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=236591","","Banking;Machine learning;Buildings;Software engineering;Mathematics;Artificial intelligence;Programming;Software design;Multilevel systems;Software libraries","bank data processing;case-based reasoning;explanation;formal specification;learning (artificial intelligence)","case-based reasoning;banking system specification;user requirements;machine learning;explanation-based learning;LISE;Learning in Software Engineering","","1","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
